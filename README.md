# Weather Project
### Sam Brown 08.11.22 - CW 2022 Summer Project

---

## Usage

This site was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I used both OpenWeatherMap's "Current Weather API" and "Geolocation API" to make this work. 

The site allows you to use your current location to fetch weather, or to search for a location. There is also a toggle at the bottom of the screen to switch units
between fahrenheit and celsius.

## Development

For my project this summer, I wanted to do something completely different from what I've been learning for a while, and decided to try to create a website
I wanted to build it within Javascript so I could learn how to use it, while also building a larger scale project.

For a while though, I was stuck trying to find good ideas for a project. Then, I had the idea for a simple weather app. I felt like it was a good idea for a project
asit encompasses old things I've learned, and things I haven't like API usage.

After weeks of working on and off, and a week of working almost non-stop, the page is live. And I'm very happy with how it came out. 

## Credits

API's Used

[OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current)

[OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)

I researched other projects similar to this one, and used some code from other sites.

I used this project to help create code for searching locations: [CodePen: Simple Weather App](https://codepen.io/tutsplus/pen/wvBoMGe/fde20df952e113289a18a65cc9bac26a)

I used this project to create the unit toggle switch: [CodePen: CSS Toggle Switch With Text](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/oNoJePo)

I also used a lot of examples from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to help build this site.

By the way, my git history is incorrect in this repo. I didn't commit very often as I should probably should have.
